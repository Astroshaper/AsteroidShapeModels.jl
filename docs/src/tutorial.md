# Tutorial

This tutorial demonstrates the main features of AsteroidShapeModels.jl through practical examples.

## Loading a Shape Model

```julia
using AsteroidShapeModels
using StaticArrays

# Load from OBJ file
shape = load_shape_obj("path/to/shape.obj")

# Load with scaling (e.g., converting km to m)
shape_m = load_shape_obj("path/to/shape.obj"; scale=1000)

# Access shape properties
println("Number of nodes : $(length(shape.nodes))")
println("Number of faces : $(length(shape.faces))")
```

## Working with Face Properties

```julia
shape.face_centers  # Center position of each face
shape.face_normals  # Normal vector of each face
shape.face_areas    # Area of of each face

# Get properties of face 1
shape.face_centers[1]  # Center position of each face
shape.face_normals[1]  # Normal vector of each face
shape.face_areas[1]    # Area of of each face
```

## Shape Analysis

```julia
# Compute shape properties
volume = polyhedron_volume(shape)
eq_radius = equivalent_radius(shape)
max_radius = maximum_radius(shape)
min_radius = minimum_radius(shape)

println("Volume            : $volume mÂ³")
println("Equivalent radius : $eq_radius m")
println("Maximum radius    : $max_radius m")
println("Minimum radius    : $min_radius m")
```

## Face Visibility Analysis

```julia
# Load shape with face visibility computation
shape_vis = load_shape_obj("path/to/shape.obj"; scale=1000, with_face_visibility=true)

# Or build visibility graph for existing shape
build_face_visibility_graph!(shape)

# Access visibility data for a specific face
face_id = 100
visible_faces = get_visible_face_indices(shape.face_visibility_graph, face_id)
view_factors = get_view_factors(shape.face_visibility_graph, face_id)
num_visible = num_visible_faces(shape.face_visibility_graph, face_id)

println("Face $face_id can see $num_visible other faces.")
println("Total view factor: ", sum(view_factors))

# Check if a face is illuminated by the sun
sun_position = SA[1.5e11, 0.0, 0.0]  # Sun 1 au away along x-axis
illuminated = isilluminated(shape, sun_position, face_id)
println("Face $face_id is ", illuminated ? "illuminated" : "in shadow")
```

## Ray-Shape Intersection

### Single Ray

```julia
# Define a ray
origin = SA[1000.0, 0.0, 0.0]  # Start 1 km away
direction = normalize(SA[-1.0, 0.0, 0.0])  # Point toward origin
ray = Ray(origin, direction)

# Find intersection with shape
result = intersect_ray_shape(ray, shape)

if result.hit
    println("Ray hit face $(result.face_index) at distance $(result.distance).")
    println("Hit point: ", result.point)
else
    println("Ray missed the shape.")
end
```

### Batch Ray Processing

```julia
# Process multiple rays efficiently
rays = [Ray(SA[x, 0.0, 1000.0], SA[0.0, 0.0, -1.0]) for x in -500:100:500]
results = intersect_ray_shape(rays, shape)

# Count hits
n_hits = count(r -> r.hit, results)
println("$n_hits out of $(length(rays)) rays hit the shape.")

# Process rays in a grid pattern
ray_grid = [Ray(SA[x, y, 1000.0], SA[0.0, 0.0, -1.0]) 
            for x in -500:100:500, y in -500:100:500]
result_grid = intersect_ray_shape(ray_grid, shape)

# Results maintain the same shape as input
@assert size(result_grid) == size(ray_grid)

# Alternative: Use matrix interface for maximum performance
n_rays = 100
origins = rand(3, n_rays) .* 2000 .- 1000  # Random origins
directions = normalize.(eachcol(rand(3, n_rays) .- 0.5))
directions = hcat(directions...)  # Convert back to matrix

results = intersect_ray_shape(shape, origins, directions)
```

## Performance Tips

1. **Use StaticArrays**: All vector operations use `SVector` for performance
2. **Batch operations**: Process multiple rays together using vector/matrix interfaces:
   - `intersect_ray_shape(rays::Vector{Ray}, shape)` for ray collections
   - `intersect_ray_shape(rays::Matrix{Ray}, shape)` preserves grid structure
   - `intersect_ray_shape(shape, origins, directions)` for maximum performance
3. **BVH acceleration**: Automatically built on first ray intersection if not present
4. **Scale appropriately**: Use consistent units (typically meters)
5. **Precompute visibility**: Use `with_face_visibility=true` when loading if you need visibility analysis
6. **Access patterns**: The face visibility graph uses CSR format - sequential access is faster than random
